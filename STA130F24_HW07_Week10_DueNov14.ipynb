    "> _In `formula='HP ~ Q(\"Sp. Def\") * C(Generation)'` the `Q` stands for \"quote\" and is needed to access column names when they have a \"space\" in their name, while the `C` indicates a **categorical** use of what is actually an **integer** valued column. Despite technically being **continuous** numbers, **integer** often simply indicate categories which should not necessarily be treated as an incremental **continuous predictor variable**. Remember, a model such as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ means for each unit increase in $x$ the outcome increases \"on average\" by $\\beta_1$; so, if $x$ takes on the values `1` through `6` as the `Generation` **predictor variable** here does, then this means the average value for \"Generation 1\" must be $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ while for \"Generation 2\" it must be $\\beta_0 + 2\\times \\beta_1$ (and so on up to \"Generation 6\" which must be $\\beta_0 + 6\\times \\beta_1$). This might be a very strange restriction to place on something that is really actually a **categorical predictor variable**. You can see in the given model fit below how this six-level **categorical predictor variable** is actually appropriately treated in the specification of the **linear form** using \"Generation 1\" for the \"baseline\" and **binary indicators** to model the \"contrast\" (\"offsets\") for the other \"Generations\"; and, how these are in turn used in the context of the **interaction** considered by the model specification._ \n",

    "> _The **overfitting** observed in the previous problem is a question of **model complexity** relative to the amount of information or evidence available in a given dataset (or we could just say \"the amount of data in a dataset\"). The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",

It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "In model4, the design matrix includes all predictor variables used to predict the outcome variable through linear regression. Its shape reflects the number of predictors and observations. Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated, causing instability in the model and inaccurate coefficient estimates. Strong multicollinearity can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Overfitting often happens with complex models that use too many predictors. A simpler model, like model3, better identifies stable relationships that generalize well to new data.\n",

Centering and scaling the predictors can reduce multicollinearity's effect, but even after scaling, model4's condition number remains high, showing that multicollinearity is still a significant issue."

    "> _While we had seemed to **validate** the **generalizability** of `model7_fit` in **model building** exercise of the previous \"Question 7\" above, as well as the improved **model performance** of `model7_fit` comapred to `model6_fit`, the `model7_fit` model was always nonetheless more complex than `model6_fit` model (as seen by comparing their `.summary()` methods). This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong. In comparision, the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model6_fit.summary()` is consistently stronger._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _As discussed towards the end of the commentary in the previous \"Question 7\" above, the primary purpose of **multiple linear regression** methodology is to allow us to assess the **evidence** (in the data) for a given **linear form** specification based on **coefficient hypothesis testing**. In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations. From a **model interpretability** perspective, understanding the meaning of the complex specification of `model7_fit` is \"challenging\" and \"complicated\" to say the least._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",

    "#### **Summary：**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Modeling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "You worked through several iterations of linear regression models using statsmodels and train_test_split. We started with model3_fit, followed by model4_fit and other model formulations, gradually expanding the set of predictors and examining their effect on the HP variable (dependent variable).\n",
    "You explored the challenges of multicollinearity, the significance of interaction terms, and the process of improving model fit by selecting relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Train-Test Split & Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion emphasized the importance of train-test splits to assess model generalization. In particular, we used a 50-50 split for both training and testing datasets and evaluated model performance with R-squared metrics (both in-sample and out-of-sample).\n",
    "We also discussed how the performance of a model might vary between training data and test data, highlighting the importance of good model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Model Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "You considered multiple model specifications, with each iteration adding new predictors or interaction terms to improve prediction accuracy, while also keeping an eye on multicollinearity and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Plotting and Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed using Plotly for visualizing model performance, specifically comparing the in-sample R-squared and out-of-sample R-squared. This helped assess the consistency of the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Replicated Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of running multiple replications (100 iterations) was introduced to evaluate the variability in the model's performance. Each iteration involved a new train-test split, with results stored and plotted for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Practical Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach you worked through is useful for understanding how models might behave with different data splits and specifications, and how tuning the model can lead to improved generalization. We also discussed how applying this methodology to other datasets (like songs, in the later example) could provide insights into the performance of regression models in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "This week addresses **multiple linear regression**, perhaps best exemplified through the consideration on **interactions** and their impact on the **model interpretation**, **evidence** and **validity* of models using **coefficient hypothesis testing** and \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparision. Exactly, as in **simple linear regression**, the correctness of **p-values** used to give **evidence** for **predictive associations** that are **estimated** from a dataset depends on the (at least approximate) \"truth\" of the assumptions of the **multiple linear regression**, which are the same as those of the **simple linear regression** with the exception that the specification **linear form** can now model a much richer set of relationships between **predictor** and **outcome variables** based on **predictive associations** observed and **evidenced** in the data. With all this in mind, and reflecting back on the **Ethical Professionalism Considerations** from the previous week concerning **simple linear regression**...\n",

What do you think are the simplest steps can you take to ensure that the conclusions of your work are both valid and reliable?

    "This homework's \"Question 3\" introduced the idea of performing some **multiple linear regression** analyses on dataset from the Canadian Social Connection Survey. While other questions of this homework focussed on other datasets, the general analyses and principles they introduce are no doubt informative and applicable to this the dataset for our course project. Ideally, this should put you in a position to quite proficiently perform **multiple linear regression** analyses for the course project if you so desire and find appropriate for the objectives of you course project submission. Thus, the following (and more) should be possible at this stage... \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select multiple **predictors predictor** from the Canadian Social Connection Survey data and examine how they jointly influence an outcome variable, paying special attention to the inclusion and interpretation of **categorical** and **indicator variables** and **interactions** (in terms of \"baseline\" reference groups and \"contrast\" or \"offsets\").\n",

    "4. Assess the presence of **multicollinearity** by considering the **condition numbers** of **fitted models** (with \"centering and scaling\") and their subsequent potential implications on **generalizability** of **fitted models**; and, perhaps even examine **pairwise correlation** and/or **variance inflation factors** for each **predictor variable** if you're feeling extra ambitious and want to go well \"above and beyond\" (in which case you could also consider the relationship between **multicollinearity** and why one level of a **categorical** variable is always omitted).\n",
